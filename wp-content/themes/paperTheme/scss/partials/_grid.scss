Stylesheet: Grid Stylesheet

I've seperated the grid so you can swap it out easily. It's
called at the top the style.scss stylesheet.

There are a ton of grid solutions out there. You should definitely
experiment with your own. Here is our favorite thus far. 

http://susy.oddbird.net/ - Grids using Compass. Very elegant.

Be sure your dev. environment has the susy gem installed first 
"gem install susy"


The basic Susy layout is composed using two simple mixins:
establish a layout context
@include container;

lay out your elements
@include span(<width>); 

******************************************************************/
@import "susy";

body { @include container(80em); }
// nav { @include span(25%); }
